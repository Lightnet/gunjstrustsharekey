//line 792
root.get(tmp = '~'+act.pair.pub).put(act.data); // awesome, now we can actually save the user with their public key as their ID.
root.get('~@'+alias).put(Gun.obj.put({}, tmp, Gun.val.link.ify(tmp))); // next up, we want to associate the alias with the public key. So we add it to the alias list.
